This file contains the on-sky efficiency curves for MOSFIRE in each spectroscopic band. 
The files called <band>eff.sm.[dat,fits] are ascii dumps and fits spectra of the efficiency
curves that should be analogous to the "predicted" curves we have been using in the past. 
That is, atmospheric absorption has been removed, and telescope reflectivity taken out so
that they can be used in the same way in XTcalc. In other words, they are for MOSFIRE only.
The telescope mirror reflectivity which reproduces the end to end throughput is

   0.95 for K
   0.94 for H
   0.89 for J
   0.85 for Y
 
The files called mosfire_*spec_cal.fits are calibration spectra such that the Y-values
are the flux density in ergs/s/cm^2/A per electron vs. wavelength. In other words, if 
a spectrum is converted from ADU to electrons, multiplying it by the calibration curve
will give an f_lambda calibrated spectrum. 

The file mosfire_zeropts_and_backgrounds.pdf is just a text document with some of the 
calculated numbers. 

Note that the sky spectra will be in a separate tarball, called MosfireSkyspec.tar.
